# Generalization
Generalization can be defined as a relationship which connects a specialized element with a generalized element. It basically describes the inheritance relationship in the world of objects.

Realization
Realization can be defined as a relationship in which two elements are connected. One element describes some responsibility, which is not implemented and the other one implements them. This relationship exists in case of interfaces.
