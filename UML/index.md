# UML

## What is Uml ?

Uml stands for Unified Modeling Language. Its goal is to provide a unified
way of representing Object Oriented Design for software or non-software systems.

# Basis of Object Oriented Design

+ **Objects** − Objects represent an entity and the basic building block.
+ **Class**− Class is the blue print of an object.
+ **Abstraction**− Abstraction represents the behavior of an real world entity.
+ **Encapsulation**− Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding the data together and hiding them from the outside world.
+ **Inheritance**− Inheritance is the mechanism of making new classes from existing ones.
+ **Polymorphism**− It defines the mechanism to exists in different forms

The first step before designing who objects interacts with one another is to 
list all existing objects of the system.

## Building blocks of UML

There are three building blocks for UML :

+ **Things**
+ **Relationships**
+ **Diagrams**

### Things

Things are the most important building blocks of UML. Things can be −

+ [Structural](./structural_things)
+ [Behavioral](./behavioral_things)
+ [Grouping](./grouping_things)
+ [Annotational](./annotational_things)

### Relationships

Relationship is another most important building block of UML. It shows how the elements are associated with each other and this association describes the functionality of an application.

There are four kinds of relationships available.

+ [Dependency](./dependency_relationship)
+ [Association](./association_relationship)
+ [Generalization](./generalization_relationship)
+ [Realization](./realization_relationship)

### UML Diagrams

UML diagrams are the ultimate output of the entire discussion. All the elements, relationships are used to make a complete UML diagram and the diagram represents a system.
The visual effect of the UML diagram is the most important part of the entire process. All the other elements are used to make it complete.
UML includes the following nine diagrams, the details of which are described in the subsequent chapters.

+ [Class diagram](./diagrams/class)
+ [Object diagram ](./diagrams/object)
+ [Use case diagram ](./diagrams/use_case)
+ [Sequence diagram ](./diagrams/sequence)
+ [Collaboration diagram ](./diagrams/collaboration)
+ [Activity diagram ](./diagrams/activity)
+ [Statechart diagram ](./diagrams/statechart)
+ [Deployment diagram ](./diagrams/deployment)
+ [Component diagram ](./diagrams/component)
