# Knowledge

This project is a collaboration between the [three of us](team.md). We use this website as a 
way to store our collective knowledge in a single easy-to-access place.

## Ressources

Here's the list of Ressources we worked on:
+ [Effective C++](effectivemoderncpp.md) (Scott Meyers)
+ [More Effective C++]([More-Effective-Cpp]-Index) (Scott Meyers)
+ [Effective Modern C++](effectivemoderncpp.md) (Scott Meyers)
+ Code Complete (Steve McConnell)
+ Game Engine Architecture (Jason Gregory)
+ Gang of Four (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides)

## [Glossary](glossary.md)

The glossary is about listing all known keywords, themes, designs... whatever comes to mind.
The point is to keep knowledge about these in a single place.
