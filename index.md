# Knowledge

This project is a collaboration between the [three of us](team.md). We collect knowledge and make a summary here on this wiki.

## Ressources

Here's the list of Ressources we worked on:
+ [Effective C++](effectivemoderncpp.md) (Scott Meyers)
+ [More Effective C++]([More-Effective-Cpp]-Index) (Scott Meyers)
+ [Effective Modern C++]([Effective-Modern-Cpp]-Index) (Scott Meyers)
+ Code Complete (Steve McConnell)
+ Game Engine Architecture (Jason Gregory)
+ Gang of Four (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides)

As you can see, our Wiki pages are all prefixed with one of these. It makes it easy to find information.

## Tools

Furthermore you can learn about the tools we use daily.

+ Git
+ Markdown
+ CLion
+ Vim
+ G++
+ CMake
+ Gtk
+ ...

The list goes on. We do not intend to provide comprehensive tutorials but rather rich introductions,
getting started tools.

## Excellence

The goal of this website is to provide information on how softwares are developed and maintained in the
"real" world. We strive to acquire knowledge and skills that will allow us to become professional software
developers. On this section you will find knowledge about famous softwares and how they came to be,
how they are designed, and what the challenges are when designing and building a professional software.
