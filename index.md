# Knowledge

This project is a collaboration between the three of us. We collect knowledge and make a summary here on this wiki.

## Ressources

Here's the list of Ressources we worked on:
+ [Effective C++]([Effective-Cpp]-Index) (Scott Meyers)
+ [More Effective C++]([More-Effective-Cpp]-Index) (Scott Meyers)
+ [Effective Modern C++]([Effective-Modern-Cpp]-Index) (Scott Meyers)
+ Code Complete (Steve McConnell)
+ Game Engine Architecture (Jason Gregory)
+ Gang of Four (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides)

As you can see, our Wiki pages are all prefixed with one of these. It makes it easy to find information.

## Tools

Furthermore you can learn about the tools we use daily.

+ Git
+ Markdown
+ CLion
+ Vim
+ G++
+ CMake
+ Gtk
+ ...

The list goes on. We do not intend to provide comprehensive tutorials but rather rich introductions,
getting started tools.
