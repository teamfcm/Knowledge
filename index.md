This project is a collaboration between the [three of us](team.md). We use this website as a 
way to store our collective knowledge in a single easy-to-access place.

## Git

### [Wikipedia Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

> Git **is a version control system** for tracking 
> **changes** in computer files and coordinating 
> work on those files among multiple people.  

> It is primarily used for **source code
> management** in software development,
> but it can be used to keep track of 
> changes in any set of files. As a 
> distributed revision control system it is
> aimed at speed, data integrity, and 
> support for distributed, non-linear 
> workflows.  
    
> Git was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 
> 2005 for development of the Linux 
> kernel, with other kernel developers 
> contributing to its initial development.  

### Why use and understand GIT ?

You do not need to understand how GIT works to use it on a daily professional basis, 
however, it is **highly recommended** to have strong knowledge
of git commands and behavior.

You **will** make mistakes in your code, using GIT **correctly**
will make it easy to correct said mistakes, using GIT **incorrectly** 
will only make matters worse, 
eventually condemning you to start from a clean, old basis. You want to avoid this at all cost.

So don't waste a second and look at our **[GIT tutorials](gittutorial.md)**!

## Ressources

Here's the list of Ressources we worked on:
+ [Effective C++](effectivemoderncpp.md) (Scott Meyers)
+ [More Effective C++]([More-Effective-Cpp]-Index) (Scott Meyers)
+ [Effective Modern C++](effectivemoderncpp.md) (Scott Meyers)
+ Code Complete (Steve McConnell)
+ Game Engine Architecture (Jason Gregory)
+ Gang of Four (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides)

## [Glossary](glossary.md)

The glossary is about listing all known keywords, themes, designs... whatever comes to mind.
The point is to keep knowledge about these in a single place.
